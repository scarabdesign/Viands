            - by dates
            - by name
            - by location
            - by price
            - auto seperate marked items bottom of list or leave in same order

Possible changes:
    - Add normal and sale price
        - sale should have a time aspect
    - Better deal with same products with differing locations
        - does location belong on listitems?
        - or are there a list of loctions for an item
            - listitems can point to another location in list
            - each location/product type should be associated with a price entry
                - instead of one to one with location/product type/price (as it is)
                - these can get defaults from UPC lookup

Research:
    - Think about distribution
        - both app and server components
