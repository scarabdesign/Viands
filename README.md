Grocery Shopping List Application\
\
Work in progress!\
\
This is an suite of applications for Windows, iOS and Android (more to be added) that allows a user to add products and line items to shopping lists and mark them off as they shop. Also boasts a barcode scanner for easy product additions and a cloud backup scheme.\

The front-end was written with .NET8 MAUI Blazor and an SQLite store. The backend API was written with NestJS/NodeJs/ExpressJS with a PostgreSQL store.
